 Description:
 This file contains most of the basic design parameters of the cdma system. Users can modify these parameters for their applications. 
 
 header parameters:
 length_tag_name is the length tag key used in the packet header generator. 
 num_tag_name is the num tag key used in the packet header generator. 
 bits_per_header denotes the number of bits per header. 
 header_mod denotes the modulation scheme for header symbols. In this CDMA system, the header is BPSK modulated. 
 header_formatter generates the header by using these above parameters. 
 To avoid evaluation error in symbols per header, bits per header and then symbols per header are automatically adjusted if error occurs. 

 modulation parameters:
 payload_mod is a list containing constellation objects to be used in a possibly adaptive modulation setup.

 coding parameters:
 A list of fsm objects to be used in conjunction with each constellation object defined above.
 The bits_per_coded_symbol of trellis codes are compared to their corresponding bits_per_symbol of modulations to ensure consistency.
 
 payload parameters:
 There are four parameters are set by the users.
 payload_bytes_per_frame is preset by the user to denote the number of payload bytes per frame. 
 symbols_per_frame is preset by the user to denote the number of symbols per frame. 
 bits_per_uncoded_symbols is preset by the user.
 crc_bytes denotes the number of crc bytes per frame generated by the stream crc32 generator. 
 crc_coded_payload_bytes_per_frame denotes the payload bytes per frame after outer crc code. 
 crc_coded_payload_symbols_per_frame denotes the the payload symbols per frame after outer crc code. 
 trellis_coded_payload_symbols_per_frame denotes the payload symbols per frame after inner trellis code.
 Trellis_coded_bytes_per_frame is the number of bytes after trellis coding.
 additional_symbols_per_frame denotes the additional symbols needed to satisfy the symbols_per_frame. It must be greater or equal to zero.
 additional_bytes_per_frame denotes the additional bytes per frame. Since we don't encode the additional bits.
 redudant_bytes_percent is the percent of the additional bytes in total bytes.
 
 training parameters:
 training_long denotes the randomly generated training sequence with the same length to symbols_per_frame. 
 training is the adjusted training sequence (maybe shorter than one frame) 
 training_percent is the percentage of power for training at the transmitter. It takes value in [0,100]. 
 
 cdma parameters:
 chips_per_symbol denotes the spreading factor which is ratio of the chip rate to baseband symbol rate.
 chips_per_frame denotes the total number of chips per frame. 
 pulse_training denotes the spreading code sequence for the training channel. 
 pulse_data denotes the spreading code sequence for the data channel. Pulse_training and pulse_data should better be orthogonal. 

 timing parameters:
 peak_o_var denotes the output correlation peak over variance value of the matched filter in frequency timing estimator. It is used for the rise and fall threshold factor of the peak detector in the frequency timing estimator. 
 EsN0dBthreshold is the SNR threshold of switching between Acquisition and Tracking mode when auto switch mode is selected. If the estimated SNR is greater than EsN0dBthreshold, the system switches to tracking mode automatically and vice versa. 
 epsilon is a small number used in estimating the SNR to avoid division by zero, etc. 
 n_filt denotes the number of matched filters used in the frequency timing estimator. 
 freqs denotes the center frequencies of the matched filters in the frequency timing estimator. These freqs values are normalized to the symbol rate.

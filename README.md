gr-cdma
=======

This is the gr-cdma out-of-tree package.
To use the cdma blocks, the Python namespaces
is in 'cdma', which is imported as:

    import cdma

See the Doxygen documentation for details about the blocks available
in this package. A quick listing of the details can be found in Python
after importing by using:

    help(cdma)

For the impatient:

1) Download gr-cdma from github
> git clone https://github.com/anastas/gr-cdma.git

2) Edit the file gr-cdma/python/cdma_parameters.py
and set the prefix variable with your gr-cdma trunk directory.

Note: this is your git directory prefix not the installation prefix!

prefix="YOUR_PREFIX_HERE/gr-cdma"  # put the prefix of your gr-cdma trunk

2) Build the package
> mkdir build_cdma

> cd build_cdma

> cmake -DENABLE_DOXYGEN=ON ../

> make

> sudo make install

> sudo ldconfig


3) compile hierarchical blocks and play with built in apps
> cd gr-cdma/apps

> gnuradio-companion &

In the gnuradio-companion environment

-- For each of the blocks listed below, open them into gnuradio-companion and compile each one (using the button in GRC that looks like a sphere and a pyramid with an arrow between them) and then reload each time (using the button that looks like a circular arrow)

"amp_var_est_hier.grc", 

"cdma_tx_hier.grc", 

"chopper_correlator.grc", 

"cdma_rx_hier.grc", 

-- Reload all blocks in grc

-- Load the application "cdma_txrx.grc" and have fun

Experiment with manual acq/tra, auto acq/tra, changing freq and timing offset, SNR, etc

-- Once you understand this you can also build the adaptive modulation/coding version of this app

-- For each of the blocks listed below, open them into gnuradio-companion and compile each one (using the button in GRC that looks like a sphere and a pyramid with an arrow between them) and then reload each time (using the button that looks like a circular arrow)

"cdma_tx_hier1.grc", 

"cdma_rx_hier1.grc" 

-- Load the application "cdma_txrx1.grc" and have fun

Experiment with manual acq/tra, auto acq/tra, changing freq and timing offset, SNR, modulation/coding type, etc

-- If you have 2 USRPs load the cdma_tx.grc and cdma_rx.grc and enjoy real-time CDMA transmission. You can also use the cdma_tx.grc and cdma_rx.grc by writting
and reading to a fifo (first do > mkfifo /tmp/cdma.fifo)

This module has been tested with gnuradio 3.7.8
